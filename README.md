# SMS Spam Filter using Naive Bayes

** In this project, we'll work with data from the UCI repository. It is a collection of about 5000 sms messages labeled either spam or ham. The goal of the project is to develop a model which can accurately classify them as spam or not. **

## Getting Started

The code can be run on a jupyter notebook. The dataset is given in the repo itself for easy access.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required packages.

#### Please make sure to run in the order of the line of codes as in the notebook.
